  """
  ### Description

  "Pusher" is a multi-jointed robot arm which is very similar to that of a
  human.

  The goal is to move a target cylinder (called *object*) to a goal position
  using the robot's end effector (called *fingertip*). The robot consists of
  shoulder, elbow, forearm, and wrist joints.

  ### Action Space

  The action space is a `Box(-2, 2, (7,), float32)`. An action `(a, b)`
  represents the torques applied at the hinge joints. 

  | Num | Action                                        | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding config) | Joint | Unit         |
  |-----|-----------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------|

  ### Observation Space

  Observations consist of

  - Angle of rotational joints on the pusher
  - Angular velocities of rotational joints on the pusher
  - The coordinates of the fingertip of the pusher
  - The coordinates of the object to be moved
  - The coordinates of the goal position

  The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(23,)` where the elements
  correspond to the table below. An analogy can be drawn to a human arm in order
  to help understand the state space, with the words flex and roll meaning the
  same as human joints.

  ### Rewards

  The reward consists of two parts:

  - *reward_near*: This reward is a measure of how far the *fingertip* of the
  pusher (the unattached end) is from the object, with a more negative value
  assigned for when the pusher's *fingertip* is further away from the target.
  It is calculated as the negative vector norm of (position of the fingertip -
  position of target), or *-norm("fingertip" - "target")*.
  - *reward_dist*: This reward is a measure of how far the object is from the
  target goal position, with a more negative value assigned for object is
  further away from the target. It is calculated as the negative vector norm of
  (position of the object - position of goal), or *-norm("object" - "target")*.
  - *reward_control*: A negative reward for penalising the pusher if it takes
  actions that are too large. It is measured as the negative squared Euclidean
  norm of the action, i.e. as *- sum(action<sup>2</sup>)*.

  Unlike other environments, Pusher does not allow you to specify weights for
  the individual reward terms. However, `info` does contain the keys
  *reward_dist* and *reward_ctrl*. Thus, if you'd like to weight the terms, you
  should create a wrapper that computes the weighted reward from `info`.

  ### Starting State

  All pusher (not including object and goal) states start in (0.0, 0.0, 0.0,
  0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0). A uniform noise in the
  range [-0.005, 0.005] is added to the velocity attributes only. The velocities
  of the object and goal are permanently set to 0. The object's x-position is
  selected uniformly between [-0.3, 0] while the y-position is selected
  uniformly between [-0.2, 0.2], and this process is repeated until the vector
  norm between the object's (x,y) position and origin is not greater than 0.17.
  The goal always have the same position of (0.45, -0.05, -0.323).

  The default *dt = 0.05*.

  ### Episode Termination

  The episode terminates when any of the following happens:

  1. The episode duration reaches a 1000 timesteps.
