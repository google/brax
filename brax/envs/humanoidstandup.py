  ### Description

  This environment is based on the environment introduced by Tassa, Erez and
  Todorov in
  ["Synthesis and stabilization of complex behaviors through online trajectory optimization"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6386025).

  The 3D bipedal robot is designed to simulate a human. It has a torso (abdomen)
  with a pair of legs and arms. The legs each consist of two links, and so the
  arms (representing the knees and elbows respectively).

  The environment starts with the humanoid laying on the ground, and then the
  goal of the environment is to make the humanoid standup and then keep it
  standing by applying torques on the various hinges.

  ### Action Space

  The agent take a 17-element vector for actions. The action space is a
  continuous `(action, ...)` all in `[-1, 1]`, where `action` represents the
  numerical torques applied at the hinge joints.

  | Num | Action                                                                             | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding config)   | Joint | Unit         |

  ### Observation Space

  The state space consists of positional values of different body parts of the
  Humanoid, followed by the velocities of those individual parts (their
  derivatives) with all the positions ordered before all the velocities.

  The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(376,)` where the elements
  correspond to the following:

  Additionally, after all the positional and velocity based values in the table,
  the state_space consists of (in order):

  - *cinert:* Mass and inertia of a single rigid body relative to the center of
    mass (this is an intermediate result of transition). It has shape 14*10
    (*nbody * 10*) and hence adds to another 140 elements in the state space.
  - *cvel:* Center of mass based velocity. It has shape 14 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and
    hence adds another 84 elements in the state space
  - *qfrc_actuator:* Constraint force generated as the actuator force. This has
    shape `(23,)`  *(nv * 1)* and hence adds another 23 elements to the state
    space.

  The (x,y,z) coordinates are translational DOFs while the orientations are
  rotational DOFs expressed as quaternions.

  ### Rewards

  The reward consists of three parts:

  - *reward_linup*: A reward for moving upward (in an attempt to stand up). This
    is not a relative reward which measures how much upward it has moved from
    the last timestep, but it is an absolute reward which measures how much
    upward the Humanoid has moved overall. It is measured as *(z coordinate
    after action - 0) / (atomic timestep)*, where *z coordinate after action* is
    index 0 in the state, and *atomic timestep* is the time for one frame of
    movement.
  - *reward_quadctrl*: A negative reward for penalising the humanoid if it has
    too large of a control force. If there are *nu* actuators/controls, then the
    control has shape  `nu x 1`. It is measured as *0.1 **x**
    sum(control<sup>2</sup>)*.

  ### Starting State

  All observations start in state (0.0, 0.0,  0.105, 1.0, 0.0  ... 0.0) with a
  uniform noise in the range of [-0.01, 0.01] added to the positional and
  velocity values (values in the table) for stochasticity.

  Note that the initial z coordinate is intentionally selected to be low,
  thereby indicating a laying down humanoid. The initial orientation is designed
  to make it face forward as well.

  ### Episode Termination

  The episode terminates when any of the following happens:

  1. The episode duration reaches a 1000 timesteps
