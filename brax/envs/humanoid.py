  ### Description

  This environment is based on the environment introduced by Tassa, Erez and
  Todorov in
  ["Synthesis and stabilization of complex behaviors through online trajectory optimization"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6386025).

  The 3D bipedal robot is designed to simulate a human. It has a torso (abdomen)
  with a pair of legs and arms. The legs each consist of two links, and so the
  arms (representing the knees and elbows respectively). The goal of the
  environment is to walk forward as fast as possible without falling over.

  ### Action Space

  The agent take a 17-element vector for actions. The action space is a
  continuous `(action, ...)` all in `[-1, 1]`, where `action` represents the
  numerical torques applied at the hinge joints.

  | Num | Action                                                                             | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding config)   | Joint | Unit         |

  ### Observation Space

  The state space consists of positional values of different body parts of the
  Humanoid, followed by the velocities of those individual parts (their
  derivatives) with all the positions ordered before all the velocities.

  The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(376,)` where the elements correspond to the following:

  Additionally, after all the positional and velocity based values in the table,
  the state_space consists of (in order):

  - *cinert:* Mass and inertia of a single rigid body relative to the center of
    mass (this is an intermediate result of transition). It has shape 14*10
    (*nbody * 10*) and hence adds to another 140 elements in the state space.
  - *cvel:* Center of mass based velocity. It has shape 14 * 6 (*nbody * 6*) and
    hence adds another 84 elements in the state space
  - *qfrc_actuator:* Constraint force generated as the actuator force. This has
    shape `(23,)`  *(nv * 1)* and hence adds another 23 elements to the state
    space.

  The (x,y,z) coordinates are translational DOFs while the orientations are
  rotational DOFs expressed as quaternions.

  ### Rewards

  The reward consists of three parts:

  - *reward_alive*: Every timestep that the humanoid is alive, it gets a reward
    of 5.
  - *forward_reward*: A reward of walking forward which is measured as *1.25 *
    (average center of mass before action - average center of mass after
    action) / dt*. *dt* is the time between actions - the default *dt = 0.015*.
    This reward would be positive if the humanoid walks forward (right) desired.
    The calculation for the center of mass is defined in the `.py` file for the
    Humanoid.
  - *reward_quadctrl*: A negative reward for penalising the humanoid if it has
    too large of a control force. If there are *nu* actuators/controls, then the
    control has shape  `nu x 1`. It is measured as *0.1 **x**
    sum(control<sup>2</sup>)*.

  ### Starting State

  All observations start in state (0.0, 0.0,  1.4, 1.0, 0.0  ... 0.0) with a
  uniform noise in the range of [-0.01, 0.01] added to the positional and
  velocity values (values in the table) for stochasticity. Note that the initial
  z coordinate is intentionally selected to be high, thereby indicating a
  standing up humanoid. The initial orientation is designed to make it face
  forward as well.

  ### Episode Termination

  The episode terminates when any of the following happens:

  1. The episode duration reaches a 1000 timesteps
  2. The z-coordinate of the torso (index 0 in state space OR index 2 in the
  table) is **not** in the range `[0.8, 2.1]` (the humanoid has fallen or is
  about to fall beyond recovery).
