  ### Description

  This environment is based on the environment introduced by Schulman, Moritz,
  Levine, Jordan and Abbeel in
  ["High-Dimensional Continuous Control Using Generalized Advantage Estimation"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438).

  The ant is a 3D robot consisting of one torso (free rotational body) with four
  legs attached to it with each leg having two links.

  The goal is to coordinate the four legs to move in the forward (right)
  direction by applying torques on the eight hinges connecting the two links of
  each leg and the torso (nine parts and eight hinges).

  ### Action Space

  The agent take a 8-element vector for actions.

  The action space is a continuous `(action, action, action, action, action,
  action, action, action)` all in `[-1, 1]`, where `action` represents the
  numerical torques applied at the hinge joints.

  | Num | Action                                                             | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding config)   | Joint | Unit         |
  |-----|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------------------------------|-------|--------------|
  | 0   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and front left hip   | -1          | 1           | hip_1 (front_left_leg)           | hinge | torque (N m) |
  | 1   | Torque applied on the rotor between the front left two links       | -1          | 1           | ankle_1 (front_left_leg)         | hinge | torque (N m) |
  | 2   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and front right hip  | -1          | 1           | hip_2 (front_right_leg)          | hinge | torque (N m) |
  | 3   | Torque applied on the rotor between the front right two links      | -1          | 1           | ankle_2 (front_right_leg)        | hinge | torque (N m) |
  | 4   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and back left hip    | -1          | 1           | hip_3 (back_leg)                 | hinge | torque (N m) |
  | 5   | Torque applied on the rotor between the back left two links        | -1          | 1           | ankle_3 (back_leg)               | hinge | torque (N m) |
  | 6   | Torque applied on the rotor between the torso and back right hip   | -1          | 1           | hip_4 (right_back_leg)           | hinge | torque (N m) |
  | 7   | Torque applied on the rotor between the back right two links       | -1          | 1           | ankle_4 (right_back_leg)         | hinge | torque (N m) |

  ### Observation Space

  The state space consists of positional values of different body parts of the
  ant, followed by the velocities of those individual parts (their derivatives)
  with all the positions ordered before all the velocities.

  The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(27,)` where the elements correspond to the following:

  | Num | Observation                                                  | Min  | Max | Name (in corresponding config)   | Joint | Unit                     |

  The (x,y,z) coordinates are translational DOFs while the orientations are
  rotational DOFs expressed as quaternions.

  ### Rewards

  The reward consists of three parts:

  - *reward_survive*: Every timestep that the ant is alive, it gets a reward of
    1.
  - *reward_forward*: A reward of moving forward which is measured as
    *(x-coordinate before action - x-coordinate after action)/dt*. *dt* is the
    time between actions - the default *dt = 0.05*. This reward would be
    positive if the ant moves forward (right) desired.
  - *reward_ctrl*: A negative reward for penalising the ant if it takes actions
    that are too large. It is measured as *coefficient **x**
    sum(action<sup>2</sup>)* where *coefficient* is a parameter set for the
    control and has a default value of 0.5.
  - *contact_cost*: A negative reward for penalising the ant if the external
    contact force is too large. It is calculated *0.5 * 0.001 *
    sum(clip(external contact force to [-1,1])<sup>2</sup>)*.

  ### Starting State

  All observations start in state (0.0, 0.0,  0.75, 1.0, 0.0  ... 0.0) with a
  uniform noise in the range of [-0.1, 0.1] added to the positional values and
  standard normal noise with 0 mean and 0.1 standard deviation added to the
  velocity values for stochasticity.

  Note that the initial z coordinate is intentionally selected to be slightly
  high, thereby indicating a standing up ant. The initial orientation is
  designed to make it face forward as well.

  ### Episode Termination

  The episode terminates when any of the following happens:

  1. The episode duration reaches a 1000 timesteps
  2. The y-orientation (index 2) in the state is **not** in the range
     `[0.2, 1.0]`
