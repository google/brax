class Swimmer(PipelineEnv):

  ### Description

  This environment corresponds to the Swimmer environment described in Rémi Coulom's PhD thesis
  ["Reinforcement Learning Using Neural Networks, with Applications to Motor Control"](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-00003985/document).
  The environment aims to increase the number of independent state and control
  variables as compared to the classic control environments. The swimmers
  consist of three or more segments ('***links***') and one less articulation
  joints ('***rotors***') - one rotor joint connecting exactly two links to
  form a linear chain. The swimmer is suspended in a two dimensional pool and
  always starts in the same position (subject to some deviation drawn from a
  uniform distribution), and the goal is to move as fast as possible towards
  the right by applying torque on the rotors and using the fluids friction.

  ### Notes

  The problem parameters are:
  * *n*: number of body parts
  * *m<sub>i</sub>*: mass of part *i* (*i* ∈ {1...n})
  * *l<sub>i</sub>*: length of part *i* (*i* ∈ {1...n})
  * *k*: viscous-friction coefficient
  While the default environment has *n* = 3, *l<sub>i</sub>* = 0.1,
  and *k* = 0.1, it is possible to tweak the MuJoCo XML files to increase the
  number of links, or to tweak any of the parameters.

  ### Action Space

  The agent takes a 2-element vector for actions. The action space is a
  continuous `(action, action)` in `[-1, 1]`, where `action` represents the
  numerical torques applied between *links*.
  | Num | Action                             | Control Min | Control Max | Name (in corresponding config) | Joint | Unit         |
  |-----|------------------------------------|-------------|-------------|--------------------------------|-------|--------------|
  | 0   | Torque applied on the first rotor  | -1          | 1           | rot2                           | hinge | torque (N m) |
  | 1   | Torque applied on the second rotor | -1          | 1           | rot3                           | hinge | torque (N m) |

  ### Observation Space

  The state space consists of:
  * A<sub>0</sub>: position of first point
  * θ<sub>i</sub>: angle of part *i* with respect to the *x* axis
  * A<sub>0</sub>, θ<sub>i</sub>: their derivatives with respect to time (velocity and angular velocity)

  The observation is a `ndarray` with shape `(8,)` where the elements correspond to the following:

  | Num | Observation                          | Min  | Max | Name (in corresponding config) | Joint | Unit                     |
  |-----|--------------------------------------|------|-----|--------------------------------|-------|--------------------------|
  | 0   | angle of the front tip               | -Inf | Inf | rot                            | hinge | angle (rad)              |
  | 1   | angle of the second rotor            | -Inf | Inf | rot2                           | hinge | angle (rad)              |
  | 2   | angle of the second rotor            | -Inf | Inf | rot3                           | hinge | angle (rad)              |
  | 3   | velocity of the tip along the x-axis | -Inf | Inf | slider1                        | slide | velocity (m/s)           |
  | 4   | velocity of the tip along the y-axis | -Inf | Inf | slider2                        | slide | velocity (m/s)           |
  | 5   | angular velocity of front tip        | -Inf | Inf | rot                            | hinge | angular velocity (rad/s) |
  | 6   | angular velocity of second rotor     | -Inf | Inf | rot2                           | hinge | angular velocity (rad/s) |
  | 7   | angular velocity of third rotor      | -Inf | Inf | rot3                           | hinge | angular velocity (rad/s) |

  ### Rewards

  The reward consists of two parts:
  - *reward_fwd*: A reward of moving forward which is measured as
    *(x-coordinate before action - x-coordinate after action) / dt*. *dt* is the
    time between actions - the default *dt = 0.04*. This reward would be positive
    if the swimmer swims right as desired.
  - *reward_control*: A negative reward for penalising the swimmer if it takes
    actions that are too large. It is measured as *-coefficient x
    sum(action<sup>2</sup>)* where *coefficient* is a parameter set for the
    control and has a default value of 0.0001

  ### Starting State

  All observations start in state (0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) with a Uniform noise in the
  range of [-0.1, 0.1], added to the initial state for stochasticity.

  ### Episode Termination

  The episode terminates when the episode length is greater than 1000.
