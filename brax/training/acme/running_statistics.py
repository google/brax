  Note: data batch and state elements (mean, etc.) must have the same structure.

  Note: by default will use int32 for counts and float32 for accumulated
  variance. This results in an integer overflow after 2^31 data points and
  degrading precision after 2^24 batch updates or even earlier if variance
  updates have large dynamic range.
  To improve precision, consider setting jax_enable_x64 to True, see
  https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#double-64bit-precision

  Arguments:
    state: The running statistics before the update.
    batch: The data to be used to update the running statistics.
    weights: Weights of the batch data. Should match the batch dimensions.
      Passing a weight of 2. should be equivalent to updating on the
      corresponding data point twice.
    std_min_value: Minimum value for the standard deviation.
    std_max_value: Maximum value for the standard deviation.
    pmap_axis_name: Name of the pmapped axis, if any.
    validate_shapes: If true, the shapes of all leaves of the batch will be
      validated. Enabled by default. Doesn't impact performance when jitted.
